# Growth-Decay-Calculator
This is a frontend application that can calculate simple and compound interest Growth and Simple Decay as well. 

This is one of the first frontend apps that I created. Originally it was supposed to be a login page with a few details but when I started
to use javascript I decided to try approaching this from a mathematical perspective. That's when I had the idea to make a simple financial calculator. 

Enjoy :D

P.S. To restart the application just type in new values.
